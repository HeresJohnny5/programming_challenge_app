# Programming Challenge App

This is my first attempt at creating a full app using Ruby, Sinatra, HTML and CSS:

1. The user can gain access to 3 different hyperlinks (FizzBuzz, Factorial, Fibonacci) in 2 different locations (Header or Body)
2. The user can easily gain access to the homepage by clicking on the logo on the top-left of the header
3. All 3 hyperlinks/tabs provide information regarding the algorithm and prompt the user for input
4. Feedback will apply based upon what algorithm the user selected and number input

## Run programming_challenge_app.rb to run the app

If you don't have *sinatra-reloader gem* please hash out **require 'sinatra/reloader' if development?** on app.rb
